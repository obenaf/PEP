/* There are 6 enemy prefabs labelled Enemy 1, Enemy 2... up to Enemy 5
 * These are used to represent the "level" of the enemy.
 * The statistics of the enemy can be customized for each prefab using the inspector
 * and by default are increased for each higher level.
 * This is a way of allowing different strength enemies on the same scene
 * rather than having them all identical.
