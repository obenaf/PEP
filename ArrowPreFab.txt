Arrow Prefab is in Luke's Assets.

It is used by the player when performing a range attack. It spawns at the player location in the Attack script when SpawnArrow() is called. It then flies toward the nearest enemy. 

It needs to be "Is Trigger" to detect collisions with the enemy. 

All code used by the Arrow can be found in the Missle script.
